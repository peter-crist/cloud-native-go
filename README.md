Scratch repository for implementing cloud native Go patterns

Running the gRPC Server:
`make serve`

Building CLI client to communicate with the gRPC Server:
`make build-client`

Run a Hello World example:
`Ensure gRPC server is running and CLI binary is built`
`make send`

Generate protofile:
`make generate`

## Stability Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
To demonstrate the CircuitBreaker pattern, start the gRPC server with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make circuitbreaker`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client cb` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server which showcases the Circuit Breaker in action!

### Debounce
To demonstrate a Debounce pattern, start the gRPC server with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make debounce`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client debounce` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server which showcases restricting clusters of requests.

### Retry
To demonstrate a Retry pattern, start the gRPC server with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make retry`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client retry` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server which showcases retrying given transient errors.

### Throttle
To demonstrate a Throttle pattern, start the gRPC server with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make throttle`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client throttle` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server which showcases throttling excessive requests.

### Timeout
To demonstrate a Timeout pattern, start the gRPC server with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make timeout`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client timeout` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server and the returned responses to observe that we can successfully wrap a timeout
around a given slow function, even if that function is out of our control and doesn't accept a context.

## Concurrency Patterns

### Fan-In
To demonstrate a Fan-In pattern in which multiple input source channels can be multiplexed to a single destination channel,
start with `make serve`.
In another terminal, run `make fanin`.
If using the CLI tool, you can run `bin/client fanin` and pass custom parameters to tweak the demo output.

Observe the log output from the server and the returned responses to see that all values can be concurrently read from the
destination channel. The number of sources is customizable and each source will be randomly assigned a number of
values to add to the channel from 1 to 10. You can visually map values that get added to the source channel and to the destination channel as indicated by the first digit.

In the example below, the value of 12 that is read of the destination channel indicates its from the 1st source channel by first digit. Similarily, the value of 22 that is read from the destination channel indicates its from the 2nd source channel:
```
2021/11/21 13:17:56 âž• Adding 12 to source channel #1 âž•
2021/11/21 13:17:56 ðŸ“– Reading 12 off destination channel ðŸ“–
2021/11/21 13:17:56 ðŸ“– Reading 22 off destination channel ðŸ“–
2021/11/21 13:17:57 âž• Adding 13 to source channel #1 âž•
```
